# Introduction👋

Welcome to CS198-75! For your first homework, you’ll be designing an iOS app that functions as a mobile bookstore. There will be no coding involved. This HW is simply to get you familiar with UI design using Figma and introduce you to common elements of iOS apps. You can expect the format of all released homeworks here on out to be in this guided doc format. Feel free to collaborate with your teammates on this homework, but remember that everyone has to submit their own homework.

## Setup🛠

For this project (and all projects), you will have a project skeleton to work off of. Majority of the time, the skeleton will be actual code to pull from GitHub. However, since there is no code involved in this project, we have provided a link to a Figma template instead (later on). Please follow the instructions below. They will walk you through creating a Figma account and setting yourself up for the HW! If you have any trouble with the process, email jordan@calhacks.io. I’ll try to help you out from there.

# Part 1: Getting Started w/ Figma 🖍

No real tasks here. Just make sure you are able to create an account and familiarize yourself with the basic tools Figma has to offer. Feel free to reference this section as you navigate the rest of the homework! 

## Creating an Account

- Go to this link: [https://www.figma.com/signup](https://www.figma.com/signup)
- Make an account with your BERKELEY email. Students get the PRO plan for free which just means you can have unlimited collaborators. But make sure to confirm your email!

## Basics of Figma

I’ll go into the basics of Figma here that should be enough to get you started. A lot of it is pretty intuitive and gets easier with practice (as all things are). However, if you do get stuck or want to read more in depth on what you can do with Figma, I definitely recommend checking out this article: [https://uxplanet.org/figma-all-you-need-to-know-156b52b88e54](https://uxplanet.org/figma-all-you-need-to-know-156b52b88e54)

### Creating a New File

Your screen should look something like this! To create a new file, select “New design file”. 

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1d4e6f5d-edb6-4167-8f57-40bd0f76f682/Untitled.png)

You can rename the file by selecting “Untitled” and typing in the name of your file. Save the draft by selecting the drop down arrow next to the title of your file and selecting “move to project”. Select your team and project.

### Editing Your File

Your design file will pop up with the workspace blank and this bar on top.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d9566ac3-eaab-4681-800d-b3aadd7d3a8c/Untitled.png)

On this bar, you will see your design tools in the top left. From left to right:

- The arrow is your select tool
- The hashtag allows you to select frames to import (we will use this in the next part!)
- The square lets you add in shapes
- The pen nib is your pen/writing utensil
- The T is to add text
- The hand lets you grab and move elements around
- The chat bubble lets you add comments to your file (useful when collaborating!)

*The right panel allows for more precise customization

### Layers & Groups

Layers and groups appear on the left panel. Every element you add creates its own new layer. You can drag and drop layers in the left panel to change how the elements present themselves in respect to other elements. You can also group elements together so that they can be manipulated all at once. I would recommend getting comfortable with using layers and groups to keep your designs organized and manageable.

This is one of my old projects. As you can see, the frame “Home” has elements tiered below it. I made groups of “HomeNavBar”, “Ad”, “About Us”, and “How It Works”. Beneath each group title are the elements that are grouped within. One thing to note is the order in which elements are listed. You can see that “Log In” is listed above “Rectangle 12”. This is done so that the “Log In” text is shown on top of the rectangle (see below). If this were flipped, the “Log In” would be hidden behind the rectangle.

# Part 2: Building the Mobile Bookstore 📚

In this homework, you will be designing and prototyping an app that functions as a mobile bookstore. You will be designing the “Welcome Screen”, “Log In” Page, “Shop” Page, “Profile”, and “Chat”. You will also practice creating flow to actually prototype and present the app as if it was fully functional. Throughout this task, I will share what I created. However, I want you to take creative liberties and make this app your own. Feel free to deviate from my designs and elaborate on what I have. I want to see everyone’s unique takes on the task. This is your opportunity to mess around and try things out :)

## Task 1: Setup

I’ve provided a template for you that will provide some icons you might find useful in designing your app!

1. Click this link: [https://www.figma.com/file/bamNPIXphcj4Dwv8rMTkpi/HW1-Template?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/bamNPIXphcj4Dwv8rMTkpi/HW1-Template?node-id=0%3A1)
2. Click on the drop down arrow next to title and select “Duplicate to your drafts”
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c3753dc6-906f-4be0-9bb6-5743fe6c9d05/Untitled.png)
    
3. Open the duplicated draft, save it to your projects, and rename this file to whatever you’d like 

## Task 2: Welcome Screen

First, we want to build the “Welcome Screen” or “Title Screen”. This is the first page that comes up when you open the app. In our case, this page will simply have the title of the app, a logo, and some sort of prompt telling the user to continue.

IMAGE

1. First things first, we need to add in this frame. We will be modeling for an iPhone 13 so click on Frames in the toolbar and select “iPhone 13/13 Pro”
    1. Add the frame to the workspace and title the frame “Welcome Screen”
2. I would suggest you fill the frame with a color. This can be done in the right panel when you click on your frame. Alternatively (and this is what I would prefer you try out), add in some shapes and design your welcome screen! My example is pretty boring with just the red, if I do say so myself.
3. Add in a logo too! I stole an image off the internet and edited it for mine. But you can play around with shapes and make your own, or there are a lot of websites that offer free icons as well.
    1. [https://www.flaticon.com/packs?search-type=packs&order_by=2&color=1&stroke=2](https://www.flaticon.com/packs?search-type=packs&order_by=2&color=1&stroke=2)
    2. [https://www.notion.vip/icons/](https://www.notion.vip/icons/)
4. Finally, use the Text tool to give your welcome screen a title and prompt for user interaction

## Task 3: Log In

Next up: Log In Page! Here you will be creating the log in page for users of your app. This is an essential page to any app so make sure you are comfortable with the various elements that go into this design.

These are the elements you must include:

1. Log In title
2. Username and Password input areas
3. Sign In button
4. Sign Up button

Once again, take creative liberties here. Think about what you would like to see on a log in page and make sure to match the aesthetic of your Welcome screen.

IMAGE

Tip: Try to mess around with the rounded corners of rectangles to get button shapes and softer input areas

## Task 4: Shop + NavBar

In this task, you will create the Shop page as well as the Navigation Bar. The Shop Page should include a title, a search bar, categories of books, and titles of books. 

IMAGE

The NavBar should be located at the bottom and host the icons that can be clicked on to bring the user to other pages. In our case, the NavBar will have “buttons” for Profile, Shop, and Chat.

## Task 5: Profile

The Profile page is a little more involved with a lot more information on it. For this task, practice getting your alignment and centering just right. Also, this is a good opportunity to see how layers and groups work! Follow my example in what should be included. 

IMAGE

As an extra challenge, add in another section for your Profile page that isn’t included in mine! Don’t forget the NavBar!

## Task 6: Chat

The Chat page is relatively simple. Follow my example below to see the general format and what elements to include.

IMAGE

Just cause, I want you to add in 3 more elements into your Chat page. I made mine very minimalistic and definitely lacks a lot of functionality. It’s your job to fix that.

## Task 7: Prototype Flow

Finally, we want to be able to turn this a somewhat functional app! Or at least a prototype that you can present showing what the app should do... 

Here’s what should be possible: (using my design as an example)

1. Pressing “Tap to Begin” brings you to the Log In Screen
2. Pressing “Go!” brings you to the Profile Page
3. On NavBar, no matter what screen is showing at the time, pressing the User Icon brings you to the Profile Page, pressing the Shopping Cart brings you to the Shop Page, and pressing the Chat Bubble brings you to the Chat Page.

In order to do all of these things, you want to select the Prototype tab on the right side.

Now, you can click on elements and drag their connections to other pages. You can also select which actions will direct these transitions to happen. Should look something like this when done:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2c27da4e-2ce6-4550-93f6-a746c1af7695/Untitled.png)

Once you’ve implemented all of the actions and transitions, press the play button in the top right to demo your app!

# Part 3: Get Creative 🖼️

## Task 1: Your Own Page

For this final task, I want you to create another page in the app. This page should be of your own design and have a separate function than that of which you already made. These are the following requirements and what we will look for when grading:

1. New icon on NavBar
2. At least 7 elements
3. Multiple colors and shapes
4. Integrated functionality within the prototype

Be Creative!

# Submission

To submit this project, take a screen recording of your prototyping of your Figma file. Click through all of the transitions so that all the pages are shown and interacted with. Save this screen recording and submit to Gradescope.
