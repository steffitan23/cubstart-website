# HW 1: HTML Basics

## Setting up your environment
First, install a code editor if you haven't already! Our recommendation is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's a free, open source editor that is very popular and has a lot of features. You can download it from the link above.

For this homework, you will be making a basic HTML website. We need to create a folder to hold all of this site's content, including its HTML file.

1. First, if you haven't already, create a folder on your computer called **"cubstart_web"** or whatever you want to name it. This folder will hold all of your Cubstart-related projects.
2. Open the "cubstart_web" folder in the editor of your choice and create a new folder. Name it **HW1**.
3. Inside of the "HW1" folder, create a new file and name it **index.html**.
    - Think of this as the homepage of your site!
4. Create a new folder within your "HW1" folder named "**assets**".
    - This "assets" folder is where you can put images from your local computer that you want to display on your site.

At the end of setup, your **cubstart_web** folder should look something like this:

<img src="/assets/hw1-setup.png" width="300"/>

# Build Your Own Site

Now that you're all set up, let's get creating!

In this HW, you will be building your first website in HTML using all of the tags and elements we learned in lecture. At the end, you should have a simple site that looks something like the image below.

<img src="/assets/hw1-ex.png" width="600"/>

## Need some help starting your HTML code?

In VS Code, to get boilerplate HTML, you can type "html:5" in your HTML file and press enter. You can also copy and paste the starter code below.

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <title> ... </title>
    </head>

    <body>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
~~~

## Requirements for Your Site

To make sure you get the hang of the basics we covered in lecture and lab, we'll be checking your final site for the following elements and styles:

- A **title** tag in the HTML `<head>` â†’ Name your site.
- At least 2 sets of **div tags** â†’ Organize your website into sections.
- **Headings** â†’ Let us know what each section is about.
- **Paragraph** tags â†’ What do you have to say about your site?
- Bolded, italicized, or underlined text using the appropriate HTML tags.
- A **list** of anything! You can list your top musical artists, the your personal ranking of the best libraries at Cal, etc.
- An **image** â†’ Spice up your site with some visual elements! ðŸ”¥
    - Add an image to your "assets" folder and use a relative URL! Check out Lab 1 slides or make an Ed post for help. 
- A **link** to a site of your choice â†’ use the `<a>` tags to link your favorite Youtube videos, a Spotify playlist, your social media handles, etc.
- Add some **color**! Use CSS selectors to make some text or a div a different color, and explore other CSS properties if you want to get a headstart on next week's content! (Intro to CSS is covered in Lab 1)

If you're looking for some resources to get started, here are some good sites:
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

## Viewing Your Site

To see what your site looks like in a browser, double click on the **index.html** file and it should open your page on your default browser! Refresh the page to see your changes!

# Homework Submission!
