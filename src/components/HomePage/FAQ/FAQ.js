      <div className="accordion__title">What do you learn in this DeCal?</div>
      <div className="accordion__content">By taking our DeCal, you'll get to start out by choosing a track: iOS development or web development. All the lectures and labs for the two tracks will be separate. <br/> <br/>Then, over the course of the semester, you'll build unique, guided mini-projects every week, learn about project ideation and design, craft a project proposal, designing application mockups, develop a full-stack resume-quality web or iOS application, pitch your final project to your peers hackathon-style, and much more!</div>

      <div className="accordion__title">Are there any prerequisites?</div>
      <div className="accordion__content">The Web development track is designed for beginner developers. While Web does not enforce prereqs, prior programming experience of any kind is highly recommended!
        <br/><br/>The iOS development track is designed for intermediate and advanced programmers. We encourage those who have some experience programming to enroll. We still do allow beginner programmers to enroll in the course, but it may take extra effort to keep up with the content during the first few weeks.</div>
