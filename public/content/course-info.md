**Course Designation:** CS 198-075 (iOS Track), CS 198-750 (Web Track)

**Facilitators:** Andy Huang, Madhav Varshney, Jessica Ng

**EECS Dept. Sponsor:** Justin Yokota

**Course Catalog:** Spring 2024

## Course Overview

Central to many aspects of software engineering, full stack development using modern tech stacks is often overlooked by traditional course offerings. The difficulty of acquiring these developmental skillsets is undeniable, especially for those with no prior/limited experience wanting to break into tech. Cubstart provides unique weekly guided full-stack projects, mentorship, and technical workshops. The final project of the semester will be dedicated to applying your skills to develop a viable product/application with a team.

## Course Material

The course content is split into lectures, labs, homeworks, and a final project. Your final project will be in teams of up to 4, so you can team up with friends or find teammates in lab and lecture. We will also have an option for random groupings for those who don't have groups.

## Course Requirements

_Prerequisites_

For the Web track, we do not reforce prereqs, but prior coding experience of any kind is highly recommended (high school course, CS10, CS61A, etc). For the iOS track, we recommend that you have some prior coding experience and/or take some introductory programming course before or while you’re enrolled in Cubstart — e.g. CS61A.

_Textbooks and Required Materials_

If participating in the iOS track, you’ll need a MacBook with macOS 12.5 (Monterey) or later that can run Xcode 14. If your Mac is mid-2012 or newer, you should be ﬁne. Older Macs may have performance issues.

## Lectures

The weekly lectures are intended to give an introduction to the contents covered by the homework due the following week. The general structure will be a conceptual overview of the highlighted topics, use cases, and real-life examples. **Attendance is mandatory** and will be recorded.

## Labs

Labs are a fun way to learn and practice the content in a more hands-on way! We have all sorts of exciting exercises for you to make your own demos and small apps. They also serve as a means of introducing the homework assignment (that was assigned the previous week) for those who are struggling to grasp certain concepts or haven't gotten around to doing the assigned homework. 

**Web**: The **first hour of lab is required**. The second half of lab serves as office hours / homework party and is optional, but highly recommended for those new to programming.

**iOS**: Lab is **optional**.

## Learning Goals
- Achieving full-stack web development or iOS development proficiency
- Tackling detailed project specs
- Project ideation and developing software in a team
- Crafting a project proposal as well as setting and meeting checkpoints
- Designing application mockups


## Grading Breakdown

| **Weight**  | **Assignment**                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 20%         | Attendance                      |

This course is fast-paced and highly cumulative. Your success will depend on your active and consistent participation. However, we understand that emergencies and personal matters do come up.

**Web**: You are allowed up to **4 unexcused absences across lectures and labs**.

**iOS**: You are allowed up to **2 unexcused absences across lectures**.

If you have extenuating circumstances and have used up your unexcused absences, please fill out our excused absences form. Excused absences do not impact your grade.

**More than 2 incomplete homeworks or failing to complete the final project will result in a NP.**

**If an individual receives unanimously poor peer evaluations from their final project teammates, their grade will be impacted, and consistently low effort will result in a NP.**

## Homeworks

The weekly homeworks are mini-projects that have a detailed, step-by-step spec for you to follow.

You have **2 homework drops** and your homework grade will be affected if you miss any more than that.

## Final Project

The last 4 weeks will be dedicated to your final project, which is ideating and building a viable product/application. You’ll be expected to meet with your project team regularly to work towards meeting the checkpoints throughout. We will be offering Office Hours support as you and your team take on this final project.

## Late Work

No late work is accepted. Homework and the final project must be turned in on time or you will receive no credit. If you need an extension, email cubstart@calhacks.io with "[CUBSTART WEB]" or "[CUBSTART IOS]" in the subject line.

## Academic Honesty

Homework assignments should be completed individually. You may only work in teams on the final project. Respect licenses of libraries that you use, and do not sabotage other students (there is no curve). Follow UC Berkeley’s Honor Code.

## Accomodations

If you need any accommodations, please contact the course staff (cubstart@calhacks.io) with the subject line “[CUBSTART WEB/IOS] ACCOMMODATIONS REQUEST - YOUR FULL NAME.” Please include your letter of accommodations and in your own words, a description of what you need to be successful in this course. Additionally, please state which track you are enrolled in.

## Other Inquiries

Any other inquiries should be directed to Ed or cubstart@calhacks.io with “[CUBSTART WEB]”  or "[CUBSTART IOS]" in the subject line.
