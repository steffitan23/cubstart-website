**Course Designation:** CS 198-075 (iOS Track), CS 198-750 (Web Track)

**Facilitators:** Jessica Ng, Madhav Varshney, Justin Wong

**EECS Dept. Sponsor:** Justin Yokota

**Course Catalog:** Fall 2024

## Course Overview

Central to many aspects of software engineering, full stack development using modern tech stacks is often overlooked by traditional course offerings. The difficulty of acquiring these developmental skillsets is undeniable, especially for those with no prior/limited experience wanting to break into tech. Cubstart provides unique weekly guided full-stack projects, mentorship, and technical workshops. The final project of the semester will be dedicated to applying your skills to develop a viable product/application with a team.

## Course Material

The course content is split into lectures, labs, homeworks, and a final project. Your final project will be in teams of up to 4, so you can team up with friends or find teammates in lab and lecture. We will also have an option for random groupings for those who don't have groups.

## Course Requirements

_Prerequisites_

For the Web track, we do not reforce prereqs, but prior coding experience of any kind is recommended (high school course, CS10, CS61A, etc). For the iOS track, we recommend that you have some prior coding experience and/or take some introductory programming course before or while you’re enrolled in Cubstart — e.g. CS61A.

_Textbooks and Required Materials_

If participating in the iOS track, you’ll need a MacBook with macOS 13.5 (Ventura) or later that can run Xcode 15. Older Macs may have performance issues with Xcode.

## Lectures

The weekly lectures are intended to give an introduction to the contents covered by the homework due the following week. The general structure will be a conceptual overview of the highlighted topics, use cases, and real-life examples. **Attendance is mandatory** and will be recorded.

## Lab/Discussion

Labs are a fun way to learn and practice the content in a more hands-on way! We have all sorts of exciting exercises for you to make your own demos and small apps. They also serve as a means of introducing the homework assignment (that was assigned the previous week) for those who are struggling to grasp certain concepts or haven't gotten around to doing the assigned homework. 

**Web & iOS**: The **first hour of lab/discussion is required**. The second half of lab/discussion serves as office hours / homework party and is optional, but highly recommended for those new to programming.

## Learning Goals
- Achieving full-stack web development or iOS development proficiency
- Tackling detailed project specs
- Project ideation and developing software in a team
- Crafting a project proposal as well as setting and meeting checkpoints
- Designing application mockups

## Grading Breakdown

| **Weight**  | **Assignment**                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 20%         | Attendance                              |
| 30%         | Weekly Homeworks                        |
| 50%         | Final Project                           |

To earn a P, you will need >= 70%. This course is fast-paced and highly cumulative. Your success will depend on your active and consistent participation. However, we understand that emergencies and personal matters do come up.

## Attendance

**Web**: You are allowed up to **4 unexcused absences across lectures and labs**.

**iOS**: You are allowed up to **2 unexcused absences across lectures and discussions each respectively**. If you are not able to attend a lecture or discussion, you can complete the corresponding alternative assignment on Ed. Completing alternative assignments will treat you as if you were there.

If you have an extenuating circumstance and have used up your unexcused absences, please fill out our excused absences form. Your grade will not be impacted by the first two unexcused absences, nor by any excused absences.

## Homeworks

**Web**:
The weekly homeworks are mini-projects that have a detailed, step-by-step spec for you to follow. You have **2 homework drops** in total which do not impact your grade. Any additional incomplete homeworks will result in a NP. Homeworks are weighted equally.

**iOS**: 
There will be no drops for homeworks or mini-projects. In the circumstance that you need additional time to complete, please ask us for an extension on Ed.

## Final Project

The last 4 weeks will be dedicated to your final project, which is ideating and building a viable product/application. You’ll be expected to meet with your project team regularly to work towards meeting the checkpoints throughout. We will be offering Office Hours support as you and your team take on this final project.

**Please do your part in the final project. If an individual receives unanimously poor peer evaluations from their final project teammates, their grade will be impacted, and consistently low effort will result in a NP.**

## Late Work

No late work is accepted. Homework and the final project must be turned in on time or you will receive no credit. To request an extension, please create a private post on Ed, clearly stating which homework assignment you are referring to and the duration for which you need the extension. Please do not email team@cubstart.com with extension requests.

## Academic Honesty

Homework assignments should be completed individually. You may only work in teams on the final project. Respect licenses of libraries that you use, and do not sabotage other students (there is no curve). Follow UC Berkeley’s Honor Code.

## DSP & Accomodations

Course policies are subject to change for DSP students.

If you need any accommodations, please contact the course staff (team@cubstart.com) with the subject line “[CUBSTART WEB/IOS] ACCOMMODATIONS REQUEST - YOUR FULL NAME.” Please include your letter of accommodations and in your own words, a description of what you need to be successful in this course. Additionally, please state which track you are enrolled in.
